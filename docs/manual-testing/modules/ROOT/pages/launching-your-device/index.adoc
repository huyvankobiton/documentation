Before you begin manual testing, you'll need to find and launch a xref:launching-your-device/what-are-kobiton-devices.adoc[Kobiton device]. Use xref:launching-your-device/using-device-statuses.adoc[device statuses], xref:launching-your-device/using-views.adoc[list views], xref:launching-your-device/using-filters.adoc[filters], and xref:_next_steps[more] to find the device you're looking for and start testing!
