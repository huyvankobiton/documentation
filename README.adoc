= Kobiton Documentation

This repository contains all the docs-as-code for Kobiton's Products. From this repository, all Standalone and Cloud Deployment documentation is generated to be packaged up for the Cloud or for the Standalone installer.

= Style Guide and Other Guidelines

This document instructs the technical writer and other contributors to Kobiton's help documentation on the styles to be used. Some styles are enforced by css and Asciidoc, while others -- what is detailed in this guideline -- ensures the look and feel of the Kobiton documentation is consistent.

== Styles

=== Product Hierarchy

Kobiton's overall product is called Kobiton; the company name and the product name are one in the same. Within Kobiton, there are three _Components_: *Device Lab Management*, *Intelligent Quality Suite*, and *Kobiton Desktop*. Each _Component_ contains many _Modules_. An example of a _Module_ within *Intelligent Quality Suite* is *Scriptless*. A _Module_ contains _Features_. For example, a _Feature_ of *Scriptless* is *Data Driven Testing*. In the case that a _Feature_ belongs to multiple _Modules_, the _Feature_ is included in each of the _Module_ documentation pages.

=== CSS Styles

The `site.css` file formats the overall site and structure. 

=== Text

==== Section Names

All section names are to be capitalized when referencing the section and not capitalized when writing about the topic. For example, both of these are correct:

> This Manual Testing section will teach you all there is to know about how to test manually.

> Manual testing on Kobiton is a breeze.

=== Images

Images may be either application / device screenshots or diagrams created in Figma.

==== Application and Device Screenshots

Application screenshots should horizontally cover the content area of the screen; text should not wrap around application screenshots. The width to height ratio should be between 1.74 and 1.80.

==== Diagrams

Diagrams should use the same font as the documentation site, Roboto, at 32pt font size. The _font color_ is the `Primary/Default` color from the *Kobiton Style Guide* Figma file. The _background color_ is `Primary/Light` color from the *Kobiton Style Guide* Figma file. The `Soft Dropshadow` is used on shapes. Lines and arrows are `Primary/Default` color.

== Other Guidelines

=== Figma

The name of the frame should include the full directory name as it will be placed into the Antora directory structure within the `docs` folder. For example, `manual-testing/modules/ROOT/images/manual_testing_flow`.

All Figma files should be exported in `svg` format.
