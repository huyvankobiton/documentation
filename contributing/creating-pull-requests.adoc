== Creating pull requests

. Open your terminal.

. Navigate to the documentation repository. +
+
.*Example:*
[,terminal]
----
cd ~/kobiton/documentation
----

. Checkout the `main` branch and confirm your local repository is up-to-date: +
+
[,terminal]
----
git checkout main && git pull
----

. Create a new branch with the `-b` flag and check it out. +
+
.*Example:*
[,terminal]
----
git checkout -b migrating-manual-testing
----
+
. Now that you've checked out your new branch, you can start editing files using your preferred text editor.
+
[NOTE]
Use our content style guide to ensure xref:content-style-guide.adoc#_product_names[product names], xref:content-style-guide.adoc#_file_structure[file structure], and xref:content-style-guide.adoc[all other formatting] is inline with our standards.

. Once you're satisfied with your work, open terminal and enter the following command: +
+
[,terminal]
----
git add --all
----
+
[TIP]
If you only want to push changes for one of the files you're working on, you can use `git add <FILENAME>` instead.

. Create a commit containing your added changes. You'll also add the `-m` flag to add a short, descriptive message to your commit: +
+
[,terminal]
.*Example:*
----
git commit -m "Updating the nav file for manual testing"
----

. Now you'll push your branch to GitHub using the following command. Replace `<BRANCH-NAME>` with the name of your branch from step 4. +
+
[,terminal]
.*Example:*
----
git push -u origin <BRANCH-NAME>
----

. Open our https://www.github.com/kobiton/documentation[documentation repository] on GitHub and log in.

. At the top of the screen, you'll see the following message. Within the message, select *compare & pull request*. +

. When you're finished filling out your PR, select *Create draft pull request*.

. Before you assign a reviewer, xref:generating-site-preview.adoc[gerate a site preview], so you can see what your changes will look like once they're added to the site.

. If you need to make any changes, simply repeat steps 5 through 8 and regenerate your site preview to see your changes.

. Once you're satisfied with your work, add *Isaiah Robinson* as a reviewer and select *Ready for review*.

. After your work is reviewed, you'll receive a notification indicating whether your PR can be merged or if it needs changes.

. Once your PR is approved, select *Merge pull request* and delete your branch.
