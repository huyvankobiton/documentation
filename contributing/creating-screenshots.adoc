[TIP]
.Ensure your measurements are equal
====
* Press *R* to create a square.
* Place square on all sides to make sure top/bottom and left/right are consistent.
* Top/Bottom need to match each other, and Left/Right need to match each other, but all four do not need to match.
====

. Copy the "subtract" layer. This allows you to subtract the outside layer from the inside layer to create a blurred effect to focus on a particular item.

. Size the "subtract" layer to match your current screenshot.

. crtl + alt + g to group the layers into one layer / "Frame".

. Center the "big" version. (If it happens to block the smaller version, feel free to move it as needed).

. Boarders of "big" are at 20.

. Drop shadow for "big" at:
* X:0
* Y:150
* Blur:250
* %:12.
